# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
	The media inventory app project will allow users to have accounts and keep 
	an inventory of items in their media collections and keep track of items loaned to others. 

	The idea for this project came from my own struggles keeping track of my movie and book collections.  
	I have loaned books to friends only to forget about it later and never get them back.  
	I have also ended up buying a second copy of a good book or movie when I found a bargain because 
	I couldn't remember at the time if I owned it.  
	

## Features
	Inventory Items:  Users will be able to keep an inventory of their media collection (Example: Books, Movies, Music).
	
	Loan tracking: Users will be able to keep track of items in their inventory that have been loaned out.

	User Login: Users will be able to have individual accounts and login.

	User Access Control: Users will have accounts and account permissions will 
	determine what a user can do and see with respect to their own and other users collections.
