# Basic Meetup Information:
	Group Name: Java User's Group
	Date: December 12, 2017
	Time: 6:30pm - 8:00pm
	Topic: Bootiful Testing
	Presenters: Josh Long & Mario Gray

# Topic Description:
	The topic discussed during the Java User's Group: Bootiful Testing 
	primarily covered testing features included in Spring Boot and how
	to test Spring Boot applications.  The presenters also covered some
	basics of the benefits of testing and test driven development.  

# Questions for Meetup:
	- What are the common ways to test Spring Boot applications?
	- How does testing a Spring application differ from testing
		a regular Java application?

# What I learned: 
	Benefits of Test Driven Development:
		- Documentation
			* Tests can aid in the write-up of documentation and tests
				can be written for each specific feature
		- Catches Bugs & fewer problems if tests are written first
			* Testing during development catches bugs earlier, so they 
				can be fixed before code gets to production.
		- Confidence and Comprehensive Test Suite

	Spring Cloud Contracts
		- Contracts 
			* Are Promises that descibe behavior, but not necessairly
				implementation details
		- Neat

	Mock Rest Service Server (WireMock)
		- Can be used to simulate pre-programmed http: request responses
		- Works in static environments

	Test Slices
	 	- Are pieces of code you expose to tests
